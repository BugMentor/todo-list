## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the **Playwright Todo App**.

This repository is utilized as the application under test (AUT) for demonstrating advanced **CI/CD Pipeline Optimization** and **Troubleshooting**. It features a modern, refactored codebase built with clean architecture principles, making it an ideal subject for robust **End-to-End (E2E) testing** and subsequent **AI analysis** of failures.

The primary focus of this project's CI pipeline is the integration of the **GitLab Duo AI** tool, which analyzes complex test failures and security reports to provide **actionable recommendations**.

---

## 2. Context: Target for GitLab Duo AI

This repository is designed to simulate the challenges addressed in the "AI-Driven Pipeline Optimization & Troubleshooting with GitLab Duo" presentation, specifically:

### ðŸš€ The Duo Troubleshooting Stage
The CI/CD configuration includes a dedicated stage, typically named `duo_troubleshoot`, which executes when a prior stage (like `e2e_tests` or `security_scan`) fails.

#### A. Pipeline Failure Analysis (Demo Scenario 1)
When Playwright E2E tests fail, this stage uses **GitLab Duo CLI** to analyze the lengthy, complex job logs.
* **AI Output:** Provides a concise, human-readable summary of the failure, identifies the likely root cause, and suggests code remediation steps, significantly reducing **Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR)**.

#### B. Security Vulnerability Analysis (Demo Scenario 2)
When dependency or SAST scans (like `npm audit`) produce dense technical reports, this stage simplifies the output.
* **AI Output:** Explains the vulnerability's impact, assigns a clear severity level, and outlines the precise steps needed to patch the issue.

---

## 3. Project Overview & Features

The TO-DOIT App is a standard web-based task manager featuring:

* **CRUD Operations:** Easily add, edit, and delete tasks.
* **Status Management:** Mark tasks as pending or completed.
* **Filtering:** Filter tasks by status (All, Pending, Completed).
* **Theme Switching:** A persistent theme switcher.

---

## 4. Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

### Prerequisites
* Node.js (LTS recommended)
* A modern web browser
* Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:abdellatif-laghjaj/todo-list.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate and Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd todo-list
    npm install  # Assuming npm is the package manager after refactoring
    ```

3.  **Run the Application (for local testing):**
    Open the `index.html` file directly in your preferred web browser.

---

## 5. Dependencies & Tech Stack

This project utilizes modern web technologies:

* **Core Language:** Vanilla JavaScript
* **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** and **Daisy UI** (via CDN).
* **Testing (External):** Designed to be run with **Playwright** (though not contained in this repository, this is the environment for the Duo demo).
* **CI/CD Tooling:** **GitLab CI/CD** and **GitLab Duo CLI**.

---

## 6. Code Architecture (Refactoring Focus)

The underlying codebase was heavily refactored to serve as a robust, maintainable target for testing. Key architectural highlights include:

* **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Logic is strictly separated into dedicated classes:
    * **`TodoManager`**: Handles all business logic and state management.
    * **`UIManager`**: Handles all DOM manipulation and event listening.
    * **`ThemeSwitcher`**: Manages theme state (using the **Singleton Pattern**).
* **Design Patterns:**
    * **Singleton Pattern** (`ThemeSwitcher`): Ensures centralized control over the application's theme.
    * **Strategy Pattern** (`TodoItemFormatter`): Ensures consistent, interchangeable formatting logic for tasks.
